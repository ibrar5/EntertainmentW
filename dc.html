There is not a single MCU movie which is not good, some are maybe not as good as expacted but some are mind blowing. So, let's see which movies have won everyone's mind and which have not.</p>

                <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">Doctor Strange is avery distinct movie like Guardians of The Galaxy. In this movie we have seen no known face. It is also a very good movie directed by Scott Derrickson. This movie is weirder and better than many MCU movie. This movie has a very good story which is much alike with the story of Tony Stark. Doctor Stefen Strange was aproudy doctor who had a vast amount of knowledge. But, his life suddenly changed because of an accident. Because of that, a very skilled doctor suddenly lost his usefullness. His hand became useless. And to fix his hand he went to Karma Taj, a completely different world. He learned about many unknown things and discovered he knew nothing. This movie is very important for both phase 3 and phase 4. It is important for phase 3 because time stone was introduced and important for phase 4 because multiverse was mentioned for the first time. This movie has no direct relation with Infinity War. But,it is pretty important and awsome movie.</p>

                <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">The First Season of Jessica Jones is unarguably one of the most important series of Netflix Marvel. In this show, very very important characters like Jessica Jones, Luke Cage have introduced. This show is the best Netflix Marvel show after the Daredevils and Punisher Season 1. Character development of this show is literally fantastic. The rivalry between Jessica Jones and Kilgrave was also amazing. Jessica Jones is a detective who is physically stronger than normal people. But, her idealism is not like a superhero at all, neither is she. She is a careless woman who don't think about herself. But, cares about people around her. But, she is not the main reason why this series is a really good one. The antagonist of this show, Kilgrave have made this show a very good one. He is basically a psychotic serial killer who have abilities, who deserves nothing but death. He does not care about anyone, even his own parents. He can controll people's mind. David Tennant really did a great job while casting this character. Honestly, I like the Kilgrave character more than Jessica. Because, I was able to hate him. But, on the other while watching Jessica Jones I really did not feel anything special. As a protagonist, her character development was not good at all. This is the only reason why this show is still a "Very Good" show.</p>

                <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">Daredevil is the first Netflix Marvel show. It is the show in which <b>The Devil of The Hell's Kitchen</b> rises. This show is a psychological show more than a superhero show. Because, the main hero Matt Murdock aka Daredevil is not a person with amazing superpower. On the other hand, the main anti-hero Wilson Fisk does not have any superpowers at all. Money and his ideology is what makes him a very powerful person. The main thing that made Daredevil a great show is it's protagonist and antagonist. It's not that Matt Murdock and Wilson Fisk have any personal relation. But their relation was more than personal just like Batman and Joker. Matt Murdock is a blind man who is a lawyer in the day and a masked and vigilante in the night who wants to protect his city. On the other hand, Wilson Fisk is a rich person who does not have any crime record. But, he had everything under his controll even FBI and ARMY. But, he is an anti-hero who cannot be hated. Because, his goal is right, and he cares very much about his lover, his best friend, his mother and his city even more than his life. He have killed a few characters in the show, but none of them were for his own happiness. He is a person who wants to rebuild his city, he is evem ready to sacrifice his life for this. Not only Netflix Marvel, Wilson Fisk is one of the best anti-hero in Marvel. On the other hand, Daredevil is one of the most loved Marvel Superhero. The saga between two person who have same goal but different way have made this series one of the best Marvel series.</p>

                <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">After Iron Man have realeased in 2008, in each and every MCU movie we have seen at least one known face. But, in MCU's 10th movie Gardians of The Galaxy we have seen only a few known face . This movie was a very distinct movie because it has no relation with the movies which have released before it. This movie was a perfect movie of rom-com, thriller, adventure, fighting and emotion. This movie have introduced Star Lord, Gamorra, Drax the Destroyer, Rocket Racoon, Groot, Yondu and Nebulla to the MCU fans. It have also introduced some very important villain including Ronan and Thanos(Thanos was already introduced in The Avengers. But, in this movie he was mentioned properly and perfectly.). This movie have a few legendary scene including "We are Groot". Whatever, don't skip a legenday movie like Guardians of The Galaxy. This movie is quiet important, too. Because this movie is mainly based on Power Stone. And this movie is the first film about the Guardians of The Galaxy. So, if you skip it, there's a chance that you will not understand the part of Guardians of The Galaxy in the later movies.</p>

                <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">Loki is a series with a completely different and new concept. MCU usually never focused in the story of an anti-hero or villain too much. Before Loki, 23 movies and 2 series have released in MCU. From them, the main character was always a hero (Iron Man, Captain America, Thor etc.) or a team of heroes (The Avengers, Guardians of The Galaxy). But, Loki is different. Beacuse, Loki has always been the best anti-hero in MCU. Although, in this series none of the characters were very good or very bad. It was like one of Loki's quote <b>"No one bad is ever truly bad or no one good is ever truly good."</b>After escaping with Teserract from New York in 2012 at a different timeline and reality. Loki found himself in a desert. But, then someone came and said to him that, he will be arrested because of the violation againts the "Sacred Timeline". Then, he discovered a new world and heard words like TVA, Variant, Timekeeper, Sacred Timeline for the very first time. At first, even Loki thought it's all an illusion. But, when he saw infinity stones are like showcase here. Then, he believed the reality. A normal person may have lost every hope after this. But, he was Loki after all. Loki went more deeper and deeper. He was discovering more and more unknown, surprising and shocking things. These surprising and shocking things are what which have made Loki a great series. I think, Loki is the funniest movie or series in MCU after Thor: Ragnarok. It is also the most misterious series in MCU. I mean you will not even know what will happen in the next minute. I don't know why but Loki was two step ahead from previous 2 MCU series Wandavision and Falcon and The Winter Soldier. I am saying it because Loki's first episode's veiwer was more than the previous series. I have already said, Loki is a series with a completely different and new concept. It's not that MCU never focused on the story of time. But, I have to say this none of those were focused like Loki's. Another important thing about this series is variant. This is the first time we heard a word like this in MCU. But, this word has a great importance this series. I can't say you must have have to watch this series, yet. But, I can say you should watch it.</p>

                <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">First of all, Joker is not a superhero or supervillain movie. Infact, it is the most realistic DC movie I have ever watched. In this movie we have not seen any superpowers, even we have not seen any fight, we have not even seen massive killing or blowing a hospital. This movie is a completely psychological movie. In this movie, we have seen how society can turn a good comedian who wants to share happiness with all other person in the society into Joker. But, what made this movie a legendary piece is Joaquin Phoenix's acting. Some moment in this movie were literally mind blowing. While watching this movie you can feel that <b>"Nobody thinks what it's like to be the other guy."</b> This movie is unarguably a masterpiece. But, I don't think that everybody will like this movie. Because, if you watch movie just for entertainment. If you always want to see something funny, action, then definitely this movie is not for you. If you watch movie to see what's happening around you in the society, then maybe Joker is for you. But, don't be careless while watching Joker, because just not your eyes, you even have to use your brain to while watchink this movie.</p>

                <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">Marvel's The Avengers is the movie which have made MCU a mega-franchise like it is today. All of the previous MCU movies were "Good" or "Very Good", but Marvel's the Avengers is the first "Great" MCU movie. This is one one of the few MCU films which have directly competed DC. Because, just before The Avengers DC's legendary film and the final sequel of Christofer Nolan's Badman, 'The Dark Knight Rises' have released. But, The Avengers was much more better than the expactation. This movie is so good because each and every character was focused properly in this movie, even the number of important character was 8 (with Loki and Nick Fury). In this movie a very talented, rich and intelligent mechanics, a scientist who became hulky after the failure of his experiment, a powerful and good soldier from the 2nd World War, The God of Thunder and two special agents of S.H.I.E.L.D formed a team named The Avengers. They saved the world from God of Mischief Loki. This movie is really a legendary and epic movie. 2This movie is one of the best superhero movie in hollywood. Don't even think to skip this movie. Because, if you skip this movie, you will not understand many important movies that have released after this movie. Besides, Marvel's The Avengers is one of the 5 most important movie of MCU.</p>
