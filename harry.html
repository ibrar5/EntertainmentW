        <h2 class="med">Review of all Harry Potter movies</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Some people think Harry Potter franchise is only for kids. The First movie is maybe. But, the rest are not. I think in every Harry Potter movie (except the first two) there was always a deep meaning, and a kid will definitely not understand that. Harry Potter franchise has begun at 2001 with Harry Potter & The Philosopher's Stone movie and in 2011 this franchise's last movie Harry Potter & The Deathly Hallows Part-2 have released.I think, this fancise is now world's best cinematic franchise after Marvel Cinematic Universe. It's hard to find a person who is a lover of hollywood movie but still have not watched Harry Potter. Every movie of Harry Potter are full of adventure, thrilling, mistery and supernatural power & 8 movies of Harry Potter are directed by only 4 directors. So, it's almost impossible to rank them from best to worst. So, I gave review of all Harry Potter movie but have not said which one is best and which is worst. So, Let's get started.</p>
        <br>
        <ul class="list-group">
            <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-info col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12 ch">

                <img class="img-reponsive col-lg-4 col-md-4 col-sm-4 col-xs-12" src="hp philosopher stone.jpg">
                <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-8 col-md-8 col-sm-8 col-xs-12">Harry Potter and The Philosophe's Stone is the first movie of Harry Potter franchise. This movie is really a good movie as the first movie. The way in which every character was introduced was very good. Just like, all other Harry Potter movie, this movie was very thrilling. The last part of this movie was literally shocking. This movie made us feel like Hogwarts School of Whichcraft & Wizardry is does relly exists. I have already said, the first two movies of Harry Potter are a little bit childish. Among them, the first one is a way more childish than the other. The graffics and animation of this movie is a bit annoying. It was not perfectfor a fictional movie like Harry Potter. However, we have to remember that, this movie have released in 2001. I have said, this movie made us fell like Hogwarts School of Whichcraft & Wizardry is real. But, it did not feels like we are in there. But, in some of the later Harry Potter movie, it did. Although, neither this movie's hidden villain(not the main one) nor Philosopher Stone have a great impact on the story. But, don't even think to skip this movie as it is a little bit childish, and animation and graffics is not so good. Infact, I think you can't skip a single movie from this franchise to enjoy it prperly. Because, every movies are very very important.</p>

                <h4>2.Harry Potter & The Chamber of Secrets (2002)- Chris Colombus&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span></h4>
                <img class="img-reponsive col-lg-4 col-md-4 col-sm-4 col-xs-12" src="hp chamber of secrets.jpg">
                <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-8 col-md-8 col-sm-8 col-xs-12">I think Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets is one of the most mysterious movie in the whole franchise. No one can tell anything about what will happen at the end, even when 80% of this movie is completed. It is a movie in which too many things were discovered like Voldermort's backgroud, why Slytherin house is cursed, similarities between Harry and Voldermort, Parceltongue etc. This movie was literally too much thrilling. I think this movie is better than it's previous sequel from every angle. This movie is a very tiny bit childish. Although, Harry was very young. They should not have have discovered too much in a single movie of 150 minutes. Although, that's not a big deal. Because, all's that end's well. This movie is one of the most important movie of Harry Potter. This movie even have direct relation with The two Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows movies.</p>

                <img class="img-reponsive col-lg-4 col-md-4 col-sm-4 col-xs-12" src="hp prisoner of azkaban.jpg">
                <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-8 col-md-8 col-sm-8 col-xs-12">Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban is the movie which have literally changed the track of Harry Potter's story. This movie is unarguably one of the best piece of Harry Potter. The childishness which was present in previous movies, was not present in this masterpiece. In this movie, some of the very very important character including Remus, Sirius Black and Wormtail were introduced. The time travel in this movie was better than even Avengers: Endgame's in some case. Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban is the only movie which have no direct relation with Voldermort. It's hard to find any objection about this movie. The story, twist, adventure, action everything was just mind blowing. This movie is maybe not as good as Harry Potter and The Half-Blood Prince or Deathly Hallows Part-2, but it is unarguably a perfect movie. I have already said, these movie have introduced some very very important character and I also said, this movie have changed the track of the story of the whole franchise. After all this good review, I don't think you will hesitate to watch this movie. </p>

                <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-8 col-md-8 col-sm-8 col-xs-12">Harry Potter and The Goblet of Fire is one of the most important movie of this movie series. This movie was definitely a good one. But, not as good as the most other Harry Potter movie. In this movie, Voldermort returns, and an important character mad-eye was introduced. Although, this movie was important. But, it was not a perfect one. I mean, there was many mistakes & this movie is one of the worst movie in this franchise. One of the very big mistake in this movie is the second main villain (after Voldermort) was introduced almost at the end of this movie. This movie also do have some very good side. Like this is the very first movie, in which a good character is killed and in this movie the most important and most powerful spell named <b>'Avada Kedarva'</b> was introduced. At the end of this movie, some shocking truth was discovered.</p>

                <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-8 col-md-8 col-sm-8 col-xs-12">Harry Potter and The Order of The Phoenix  is the first movie directed by David Yates. And unlike his last 3 movie Haarry Potter and The Order of The Phoenix is not a great success. In this movie, one of the most hated character in Harry Potter, Bellatrix was introduced. In this movie movie one of the very dearest person to Harry Potter have killed by her. In this movie, we have seen the fight between two strongest wizard, Dumbledore and Voldermort. I have already said, a very important servant of Voldermort was introduced and also a very important character have died. But, still I think this movie does not have a great impact. Cause, after every movie always a shocking truth about Harry or Voldermort was discovered. In this movie, also something was discovered. That is only one of Harry or Voldermort would be alive at the end. I mean that is not so shocking. I mean, anybody would guess it. So, in this case I think this movie is the least important movie of this franchise. However, remember I said you should not skip any movie.</p>

                <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-8 col-md-8 col-sm-8 col-xs-12">I think Harry Potter and The Half-Blood Prince is the best movie after Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows-II. In this movie, one of the dearest Harry Potter Character have died. The love story of Harry and Ginny as weel as the love story of Harmione and Ron have started in this movie. A little mistery of Misterious Proffessor Severus Snape was discovered. But, after watching the final movie, you would understand the mistery was not sloved at all. By the way, in this movie, a very familiar question <b>Why Voldermort is still alive after Harry killed him at the chamber of Secrets</b>. This movie is not only a normal Harry Potter movie which is full of adventure, thriller and shocking moments. This movie is a special one, because it is the end of the beginning, and the beginnning Of the end. This awesome movie can't be explained with words. it was literally more than perfect. If you are an emotional guy, then prepare yourself with tissue box, before watching this movie. Even, if your heart is made of stone, this movie will definitely make you emotional.</p>

                <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-8 col-md-8 col-sm-8 col-xs-12">Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows Part-1 is the first part of the final movies of Harry Potter Franchise. This is the only Harry Potter movie in which we have not seen Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. This is the movie, in which Voldermort had everything under his controll. Everything means everything, from Ministry of Magic to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Nowhere is safe for Harry and his friends, even the muggle world. We have seen Dobby for the first time in this movie after Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets. This movie was different from other Harry Potter movies. The way this movie ends, was literally unique. Action, thriller and shocking moments were not the main thing. The main thing was adventure. Adventure of how Harry and others can hide themselves from Voldermort's Army. How they can live in the muggle's world. This movie is just the previous part of the final movie. They are like same movie with a big break. You would understand why I'm saying this after watching all movies. And if you have watched, you already know what I mean.</p>

                <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-8 col-md-8 col-sm-8 col-xs-12">I don't know you noticed it or not but I gave 6 stars for  this movie. It deserves it. What a finale it was!! I have not seen a proper finale like this in my whole life. Almost nothing was abandoned. Said 'Almost', because Nicholas Flamel and Philosopher's stone from the first movie was kind of abandoned. But except this I think every unanswered question was answered including: why Snape saved Harry in the first movie, why he hates Harry's father, why only Harry dreams about Voldermort, and many other unanswered question. Many very very important characters have died in this movie. While watching this movie, you would understand Dumbledore is not so good as we thought he is, and Snape has reasons behind every bad things he did. We have got all the answers about the most mysterious character Proffessor Severus Snape in this movie. I would suggest to keep a full box of tissue if you are an emotional guy. If you are not then one or two would be enough. Anyone would cry after watching the scene when Severus Snape said <b>Always</b>. If you have watched this movie maybe you can watch that scene in your mind's eyes. If you have not then watch it and you will understand what I mean. Earlier, I said a kid will not understand the deep meaning of later Harry Potter movies. If you have not watched movies from Harry Potter franchise, then what are you waiting for? If you have watched it in your childhood, then you can watch it again to understand the deep meaning. I'm sure you will not regret it.</p>
