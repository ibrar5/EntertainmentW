It is based on Marvel commics. 25 movies and 4 TV series have been released since 2008. These movies are completely watchable for all age. If your age is more than 10, you can watch these movies. These movies are the best movies for teenagers in the world. Usually, 2 or 3 movies of MCU releases per year. So, we can say this universe is extending day by day. If you are a marvel commics lover, then what are you waiting for. You should watch this movies as soon as you can. There is not a single MCU movie which is not good, some are maybe not as good as expacted but some are mind blowing. So, let's see which movies have won everyone's mind and which have not.</p>

                <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">Captain Marvel is the movie in which MCU's one of the strongest hero Capatain Marvel was introduced. This movie have released between Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame. This is the first movie of any women hero. and the superhero of this movie is stronger than even Thor. So, we expected something very special from this movie. But, this movie have not fullfilled our expactation at all. I am not saying that this is not a good movie. But, the story was just too simple. This movie is not only a movie in which Captain Marvel was introduced to the fans. It is also a movie of Nick Fury's past. In this movie Nick Fury thought about the Avengers for the first time. Some mystery like how Nick Fury lost his eye and from where the name 'Avengers' came from were discovered in this movie. This movie have also introduced Monica Rambeau, who is an important character, as the daughter of Maria Rambeau. This movie is an important movie and also a fine marvel movie. But, not better than "Fine". By the way, this movie must should be watched to enjoy Endgame and phase 4 properly.</p>

This movie is a perfect sequel of the first Ant-Man. However, in this movie many things have changed. The first Ant-Man was the adventure of how Scott Lang have become Ant-Man. But in this movie it was not just about him. Hope Van Dyne have became the the Wasp in this movie. Not only that, this movie has introduced Quatum Tunnel to us. Which is very important for Endgame. This movie is almost like the previous Ant-Man. But, this movie was full of plotwholes. Ant Man & The Wasp has made the same mistake as Iron Man 2 did and the ending of this movi was not so cringy and not good, at least not as good as other MCU movies. But, this movie's fun and adventure have covered it. By the way, if you do not watch this movie before Endgame, you might face some problem while watching Endgame.</p>

This movie was a balanced movie. This movie is a forgotten MCU hit. Almost every MCU fans have forgotten about this movie. Thor is not a boring movie like the Alan Taylor's Thor: The Dark World and also it's not a legendary movie like Thor: Ragnarok. This movie is a perfect movie. Thor is a combination of everything. The plot of this movie was fantastic, funnyand emotional scenes were well-balanced. This movie had everything. But, everything was like less than enough. I can't say that, this movie is a boring movie or this movie was an imperfect movie. This movie was a very good movie, but not a great movie. By the way, this is one of the most important of phase 1. This movie should must be watched to enjoy 'The Avengers' movie, properly. Because, Thor, Loki, Asgard, Odin and many other important things were introduced.</p>

This movie is about Scott Lang's earlier life and how he have became the ant-man. This movie is a different movie. Because, this is the first movie in which the character have become a superhero in a world where the Avengers already exist. In this movie Scott Lang, Hope Van Dyne and Hank Pym were introduced. The story of this movie is based on the character 'Scott Lang', who have become a super hero from a theif. This movie is a very interesting, twisted and funny movie and because of that I think this movie is a perfect movie. This movie has everything but almost no emotional scene. But, I don't think that really matters. But there is one thing that really is a matter, and that is while watching this movie we felt like Scott Lang is not so much important superhero. I mean we felt like he will just be a sidekick of the Avengers and will never play a very important role. By the way, you should watch this movie to enjoy Ant-man's part properly in each and every movie.</p>

This movie is just about Tony Stark's past mistake, which have no relation with any other MCU movie. You just have to watch the previous Iron Man movie to know the character, except this Iron-Man 3 is like a solo superhero movie. This movie was the final sequel of Iron Man. So, we expected something special from this movie. At least, better than the previous Iron man directed by Jon Faverau. And Shane Black was ale to fullfill our hope. This movie is not only a simple superhero movie. Shane Black have made Iron Man 3 a movie with variation. This movie is also a lessonable movie. Iron Man 3 was the perfect ending for MCU's legend Iron Man. Emotion, action, lesson, adventure all of this things were present and balanced. However, this movie does not have any relation with other MCU movies. So, it is most probably the one and only skippable moie of the whole MCU.</p>

This series is also like a 'Captain America-4', because Falcon and Bucky Burnes were Captain America's two nearest person after he was saved from ice. And secondly, Sam Wills and Bucky Burnes' relation have become better in this show and both of them plays very important role especially Sam. In this series, we have seen some old faces who were unseen since Captain America: Civil War, like Sharon Carter and Zemo. Don't skip this series just because it is not a movie. This series is like an important MCU movie of five hours. This series contains a very twisted story. It is also a very important series. Kari Skogland have introduced the Flag Smashers in this movie. We have also seen many super soldiers in this. This series is important for phase 4 and it is really a very good one.</p>

This movie introduced Steve Rogers as the Captain America, his best friend Bucky Burnes, his girlfriend Peggy Carter, Hydra and Red Skull to us. In this movie the super soldier serum was introduced clearly for the first time. I used 'clearly' because it was already mentioned in The Incredible Hulk. But, The Incredible Hulk is not a proper MCU movie and it was not mentioned properly. Whatever, Captain America: The First Avenger is a completely balanced movie. We can see everything including fun, adventure, fighting and emotional scene in this movie. This movie's last word "I had a date" is one of the most emotional scene in MCU. The fights of this movie were literally fantastic. This movie is MCU's first stone related movie. The Space Stone or Teserract was introduced to the fans in this movie. This movie is a very important movie. You must have to watch this movie. Because without watching this you will understand almost nothing of The Avengers movie.</p>

Because of Corona pandemic this series have released after two years of Spider-man: Far from home. So, MCU fans wanted something very special from this series. But, Wandavision have almost failed to fullfill the expactation. Why I used "Almost"?, you already know it if you have watched the show. Anybody would doubt, it is an MCU series or not after watching the first three episodes of this series. 'First impression is the best impression', but Wandavision's first impression was too bad. But, I must have to say this, Wandavision's later episodes were pretty amazing. Also, these episodes are very important. In these episodes, Wanda's power have explained, and some major incident have happened. This movie will play an important role in Doctor Strange: In The Multiverse of Madness. Wandavision would have listed much higher in this list, even in the top 10 if earlier episodes of this series were a little better.</p>

                <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">What If is unarguably Marvel's most wierd and unique show. It is currently the only animated movie or show in MCU. In this show we have seen eight alternate universe in which everything have changed just for one event, mistake or decision. Excepth the final episode no episode have any relation with the other episodes. First eight episodes were completely different 8 stories. You can just select and watch amy episode. But you must have to watch all the eight episodes before watching the final episodes. This series was definitely exceptional. But, while watching this series, I really have not felt anything special, except in episode 4, 8 and 9. As for the characters, it was also same I have not felt anything special the Watcher and Doctor Strange Supreme. All episodes of this show were just too fast. I know that, here the same story is just repeating in a different way. But, a movie of 120 minutes is cnverted into an episode of 30 minutes. Another problem is the antagonist of this show, Ultra-Vision was just too much powerful. Even very very strong character including the Watcher and Doctor Strange Supreme was unale to defeat him. He Cut the mad Titan into pieces while he just had 1 infinity stone and Thanos had 5. The final battle was legendary. Animation was world class. But, the animation while talking could have been better. I don't think What if's story will have any effect in <q>Marvel Cinamatic Multiverse.</q> But Character like Watcher and Doctor Strange Supreme may have.</p>

This movie is about Peter Parker after Tony Stark have died. In this movie, Peter Parker have become a perfect Avenger from a neighbourhood hero. He saved the world from one of Tony Stark's business rival. We have seen the rommance of Peter and MJ for the first time in this movie. We had a high expactation for this movie, as it was released after Endgame, more importantly it is the second sequel of MCU's great film, Spider-Man: Homecoming. This movie have fullfilled our expactation. This movie contains one of MCU's most twisted plot. By the way, this movie is the previous sequel of phase 4's unreleased movie Spider-Man: No Way Home, which might be a very special movie for MCU fans. So, you must have watch this movie to enjoy Spider-Man: No Way Home.</p>

So, everybody had a high expactation for this movie. This movie have fullfilled everyone's expactation. This movie was a perfect movie for a teenager and neighbourhood hero, which makes this movie a different one from the previous Spider-Mans. The villain in this movie was also not like someone who is going to destroy whole nation, city or humanity unlike the previous spider-man movies. This movie definitely feels more realistic then it's previous versions. This movie was thrilling, funny, full of adventure and have a very twisted plot. This movie pulls a very perfect villain twist.The real identity of Vulture was really shocking. This movie was more than expected and too perfect. By the way, Spider-Man: Homecoming is not directly related to Avengers: Infinity War. But to enjoy Spider-Man: No Way Home you must have to watch this movie.</p>

This movie is a very good movie like it's previous sequel. Infact, Guardians of the Galaxy 2's plot is more twisted than it's previous sequel. This movie is a distinct movie which have no relation with any movie which have released before this, except it's previous sequel. This movie is full of rom-com, thriller, adventure and emotional scene. Honestly, I think Guardians of the Galaxy and Guardians of the Galaxy 2 are almost same. Both of them are really legendary film. This movie's twisted plot is the main reason why this movie is this much good. In this movie, one of the member of Guardians, Mentis have introduced and a very important character have died, which is unarguably of the most sorrowful death in MCU. By the way, this movie has a direct relation with Avengers: Infinity War. So, you should watch this movie.</p>

But, in MCU's 10th movie Gardians of The Galaxy we have seen only a few known face . This movie was a very distinct movie because it has no relation with the movies which have released before it. This movie was a perfect movie of rom-com, thriller, adventure, fighting and emotion. This movie have introduced Star Lord, Gamorra, Drax the Destroyer, Rocket Racoon, Groot, Yondu and Nebulla to the MCU fans. It have also introduced some very important villain including Ronan and Thanos(Thanos was already introduced in The Avengers. But, it was only in post-credit scene). This movie have a few legendary scene including "We are Groot". Whatever, don't skip a legenday movie like Guardians of The Galaxy. This movie is quiet important, too. Because this movie is mainly based on Power Stone and this is the reason I ranked Guardians of The Galaxy higher than Guardians of The Galaxy-2. And this movie is the first film about the Guardians of The Galaxy. So, if you skip it, there's a chance that you will not understand the part of Guardians of The Galaxy in the later movies.</p>

We expected that Avengers: Age of Ultron will surpass it's previous sequel. But this movie is not even close to it's previous sequel. However, Age of Ultron is still a legendary film. This movie has a very wierd plot. After all, this movie's main villain is not even a living thing, which is created by one of the Avengers. This movie's main villain Ultron was the toughest opponent for the Avengers after Thanos. Age of Ultron is one of the 5 most important movie of MCU. This movie have introduced Vision, Wanda Maximoff and Pietro Maximoff. You must have to watch this movie. Because I have already said it is one of the 5 most important MCU movie.

                <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">Doctor Strange is a very distinct movie like Guardians of The Galaxy. In this movie we have seen no known face for the first time in any MCU movie. It is also a very good movie directed by Scott Derrickson. This movie is weirder and better than many MCU movies. This movie has a very good story which is much alike with the story of Tony Stark. Doctor Stefen Strange was a proudy doctor who had a vast amount of knowledge. But, his life suddenly changed because of an accident. Because of that, a very skilled doctor suddenly lost his usefullness. His hand became useless. And to fix his hand he went to Karma Taj, a completely different world. And that is the moment when he stepped into a completely different life. This movie is very important for both phase 3 and phase 4. It is important for phase 3 because time stone was introduced and important for phase 4 because multiverse was mentioned for the first time. This movie has no direct relation with Infinity War. But,it is pretty important and amazing movie.</p>

                <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">Iron Man is MCU's first and oldest movie. MCU is now world's greatest cinematic universe because of a beginning like this. This movie is nothing in front of movies like Endgame and Infinity War. I even think that Iron Man-3 is better than the first Iron Man, in some cases. But, those movies and Iron Man is not same. Those movie have released in world's greatest cinematic universe. But, Iron Man had no platform when this movie has released and Marvel have struggled a lot just to release this movie. They were even ready to work with a non-popular director and a drug addicted actor. Because MCU was not today's MCU when this movie have released. Before Iron Man have released, Marvel was nothing in front of DC. Like Marvel, Iron Man was also not so famous. Nobody have expected something good from this movie and on the same year DC's legendary movie The Dark Knight have released. But, everything changed after this movie was released. This movie may not be a legendary movie compairing with some latest MCU movie. But, this movie was really a legendary one when it was released. Even one whole movie can be created to just show how Marvel have struggled for this movie.Whatever, this movie must be watched without any question. After all, this is the beginning of MCU.</p>

This movie is without any doubt, an epic movie. This movie is full of surprises. Captain America, Natasha Romannof and Nick Fury discovered that Hydra is not extinct or destroyed, it was actually hidden in S.H.I.E.L.D for almost 70 years. The first movie of Captain America was how Hydra harmed the world at the time of 2nd World War. And this is the movie where Hydra was harming the world in the modern era. But Hydra is not the most shocking and surprising part of this movie. The most shocking part is Winter Soldier, which is unarguably one of the mist shocking moment in MCU. This is the first movie where the main villain (Alexandar Pierce) is powerless. The battle between Captain America and Winter Soldier was really a legendary battle. Don't even think to skip this movie. Because if you do, you are going to miss a really legendary movie. This movie is pretty important, too. Because, in this movie one of the main enemy and threat to the Avengers, Hydra was introduced.</p>

                <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">Loki is a series with a completely different and new concept. MCU usually never focused in the story of an anti-hero or villain too much. Before Loki, 23 movies and 2 series have released in MCU. From them, the main character was always a hero (Iron Man, Captain America, Thor etc.) or a team of heroes (The Avengers, Guardians of The Galaxy). But, Loki is different. Beacuse, Loki has always been the best anti-hero in MCU. Although, in this series none of the characters were very good or very bad. It was like one of Loki's quote <b>"No one bad is ever truly bad or no one good is ever truly good."</b>After escaping with Teserract from New York in 2012 at a different timeline and reality. Loki found himself in a desert. But, then someone came and said to him that, he will be arrested because of the violation againts the "Sacred Timeline". Then, he discovered a new world and heard words like TVA, Variant, Timekeeper, Sacred Timeline for the very first time. At first, even Loki thought it's all an illusion. But, when he saw infinity stones are like showcase here. Then, he believed the reality. A normal person may have lost every hope after this. But, he was Loki after all. Loki went more deeper and deeper. He was discovering more and more unknown, surprising and shocking things. These surprising and shocking things are what which have made Loki a great series. I think, Loki is the funniest movie or series in MCU after Thor: Ragnarok. It is also the most misterious series in MCU. I mean you will not even know what will happen in the next minute. I don't know why but Loki was two step ahead from previous 2 MCU series Wandavision and Falcon and The Winter Soldier. I am saying it because Loki's first episode's veiwer was more than the previous series. I have already said, Loki is a series with a completely different and new concept. It's not that MCU never focused on the story of time. But, I have to say this none it's previous had focused like Loki. Another important thing about this series is variant. This is the first time we heard a word like this in MCU. But, this word has a great importance this series. I can't say you must have have to watch this series, yet. But, I can say you should watch it.</p>

All of the previous MCU movies were "Good" or "Very Good", but Marvel's The Avengers is the first "Great" MCU movie. This is one of the few MCU films which have directly competed DC. Because, just before The Avengers DC's legendary film and the final sequel of Christofer Nolan's Badman, 'The Dark Knight Rises' have released. But, The Avengers was much more better than the expactation. This movie is so good because each and every character was focused properly in this movie, even the number of important character was 8 (with Loki and Nick Fury). In this movie a very talented, rich and intelligent mechanics; a scientist who became hulky after the failure of his experiment; a powerful, good and super soldier from the 2nd World War; The God of Thunder and two special agents of S.H.I.E.L.D formed a team named The Avengers. They saved the world from God of Mischief Loki. This movie is really a legendary and epic movie. This movie is one of the best superhero movie in hollywood. Don't even think to skip this movie. Because, if you skip this movie, you will not understand any important movies that have released after this movie. Besides, Marvel's The Avengers is one of the 5 most important movie of MCU.</p>

All of the heroes who were introduced untill then was present in this movie excluding Thor, Hulk and the Guardians of The Galaxy. Fan-favorite teenager hero Spider-Man and T'challa, the king of Wakanda was introduced in this movie. Like Captain America's previous sequel, Civil War's main villain was also powerless. But, Zemo is really a super intelligent and unarguably one of the most clever character in MCU. Avengers have divided into two because of Zemo and some misunderstanding between Tony Stark and Steve Rogers. This movie is much higher in this list because of the fights in this movie. The final battle between Captain America and Iron Man was legendary and the Airport battle between among Iron-Man, War-Machine, Black Widow, Vision, Black Panther, Spider-Man and Captain America, Winter Soldier, Falcon, Hawkeye, Wanda, Ant-Man is one of the best battle between superheroes. This movie is really an epic movie. But, just like The Avengers this movie have directly competed DC. In fact, here the competition was much more than before. Because Captain America: Civil War and Badman vs Superman: Dawn of Justice are really similar movie. But, Captain America: Civil War is far more better than Badman vs Superman. By the way, this movie is not only a good movie, it is also an important one. As, Avengers have divided into two in this movie. This movie has a great impact on Avengers: Infinity War. This movie is like a bridge between Avengers: Age of Ultron and Avengers: Infinity War. So, you can't skip this movie.</p>

This movie is the story about King T'challa who was introduced in Captain America: Civil War and also the story of Wakanda, the land of vibranium. This movie is exceptional and special because of african culture. This is the first MCU movie in which the main hero is a black-man. Black Panther has a very twisted plot. There were two very important villain in this movie. On the first half, the main villain was Eulisis Claw who was  Waharmingkanda by taking their vibraniums for more than 3 decadesThe Second Half of this movie is the real surprise. We have seen one of the best villain in MCU in this movie. Black Panther movie is full of adventure, thriller, fun and specially african culture. While watching this movie, I felt that vibranium and Wakanda are real. Whatever, Black Panther is not so important for Infinity War, but this movie have explained about vibranium which was introduced in MCU in 2011 (Captain America: The First Avenger) seven years before this movie was released. Try not to skip this movie. Because if you skip this, you will miss a legendary and one of the best movie of MCU.</p>

                <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">Thor: Ragnarok is one of those MCU movies which have earned a lot and made MCU world's most successful cinematic universe. But, honestly nobody had a high expactation for this movie. Because Kenneth Brannagh's Thor was perfect but ordinary and Alan Taylor's Thor: The Dark World is an example of failure MCU movie and the previous Thors were not too funny. Infact, in Thor's second sequel there was almost no fun. But, Taika Waititi's Thor: Ragnarok is completely opposite of the previous Thors. I think, Thor: Ragnarok is currently MCU's best solo film. And Thor: Ragnarok is currently MCU's funniest movie. Taika Waititi have not followed the theory of previous Thors. First of all, Taika Waititi have abandoned some very important character. In previous Thors, Jain Foster was the most important character after Thor. But, she was abandoned. However, she will return in Thor: Love and Thunder movie. Asgard's mighty three have played a really important role in the previous Thors. But, in this movie they they were shown just because Taika Waititi needed an excuse to abandon them. This movie's story was mainly about Thor who left earth and Asgard in search of Infinity Stones and Hulk who have mistakenly lost his way and left the earth in Avengers: Age of Ultron movie. We have seen a changed Thor in this movie. In the beginning of this movie thor was the king of Asgard with long hair, with his main weapon Mjolnir. He was a prince who had everything. But, in the end of this movie Thor was a short-haired orphan who had no land, no friends, no family. He had lost everyone ans everything in this movie except Loki. Although, he is going to lose him, too. But, in the end of this movie Thor became a real God of Thunder and he proved that his hammer Mjolnir was not the source of his power. In this movie, we have seen two very important and strong villain (Hela and Surtur) and Thor: Ragnarok is the only MCU movie in which the main villain was not defeated by a hero. Thor: Ragnarok is not one of the 5 most important MCU movie. But, it is pretty important. After all, in this movie many important things and people related to Thor have lost everything</p>

Avengers: Infinity War is an epic and a legendary movie. Everybody had a high expactation for this movie. But even after that, Avengers: Infinity War have exceeded everyone's expactation. This is may be the only MCU movie in which importancy of the main villain is more than each and every heroes. Russo brothers have proved that they are very good directors by directing this movie. Because, not 1 or 2 not even 10. There was total 24 heroes in this movie of 150 minutes and each and every one of them had their own interlinked arcs. This movie is one of the best MCU movie because of it's battle. This is currently the best action MCU movie. Because, almost 70% of this movie was battle. Thanos the Mad Titan have attacked the universe including The Avengers and Guardians of The Galaxy, to gain the six infinity stones, and he made Avengers and people across the universe just to make his dream. We have seen many awful deaths in this movie. This is the only MCU movie whose ending is not a happy ending. In some cases, Avengers: Infinity War is even better than Avengers: Endgame. Even, I like Avengers: Infinity War more than Endgame. But, after all Endgame is the last movie of The Infinity Saga and end of a phase. Although for the welfare of MCU it was impossible to make Avengers: Infinity War better than Avengers: Endgame. Because, Infinity War and Endgame are like 2 parts of the same movie. So, if the first part is better than the second, MCU itself would be harmed. However, Avengers: Endgame's viewers is still more than the viewers of Avengers: Infinity War. But, you must have to watch Infinity War before Endgame. Because, I have already said, Infinity War and Endgame are like 2 parts of a same movie.</p>

                <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">Avengers: Endgame is the most important movie of MCU. This movie is currently hollywood's most earned movie. Avengers: Endgame is the second part of Avngers: Infinity War and it is the last sequel of Avengers, released untill now. This movie's concept was changed and this movie is not like a general MCU movie. Because, there was a timeskip of 5 years after the snap of Thanos. This movie is full of unexpected and surprising scene and the most surprising thing was Time Heist. We have seen many scenes from the past movies while The Avengers was travelling time. The Time Travel was very adventurous, funny, thrilling and emotional. Each and every hero who was introduced untill then and alive were present in this movie. But, unlike Avengers: Infinity War every one of them did not have their own interlinked arcs. This movie is mainly the story about 11 Avengers (Tony Stark, Steve Rogers, Thor, Bruce Banner, Clint Barton, Natasha Romannof, Rhoodey, Scott Lang, Nebulla, Rocket and Carrol Danver) who have struggled to save their friends and 50% of all living beings in the universe. Also unlike Avengers: Infinity War this movie has a happy ending. But, even after that three of the most important's character's part have ended in this movie. I have already said, 70% of Avengers: Infinity War is battle. But, Endgame is not like that. Infact, in this movie of 180 minutes there was only one important fight of 40 minutes in this movie. But, the fight of full Avengers with Thanos and his army is unarguably one of the best fight in MCU. I think I don't have to say you can skip this movie or not because most of the people who still have not watched the movies of MCU wants to watch these movies only to enjoy and understant Avengers: Endgame properly.</p>
