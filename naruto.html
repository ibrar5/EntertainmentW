He have passed a life of spy, he have sacrificed everyone and everything for Konoha. He have passed a very desperate life, he was a light in darkness. Itachi is a very intelligent Shinobi who have acted like a villain. He have wiped out his full clan including his friends, girlfriend and even parents under because Uchiha were trying to harm Konoha. Everybody in the village but Jiraiya and Sarutobi hated Itachi. Even Itachi's younger brother Sasuke hated him. However, Itachi was very loyal. He never leaked an information about Konoha. He have never told his truth to anyone. He have not told Sasuke his truth, even in his death fight. He have loved Konoha more than anything and anyone and he loved Sasuke more than even his country.

He have created the Rasengan. Minato's Flying Raijin Jutsu is faster than any other teleportation Jutsu. He can teleport even very large thing like Bijuu bomb. However, only with speed he is weaker than Shinobi like Itachi, Nagato, Gai, Kabuto or even Kakashi. But, if he have the Chakra of nine-tailed beast, he is stronger than them. It means he was pretty strong after he was reanimated by Orochimau.</p>

He wanted to bring peace in the Shinobi World. He uses toad as his weapon. So, he is known as the toad Sage. He and his toads may not look like very strong. Jiraiya's incomplete Sage mode is enough to destroy a member of Akatsuki like Pain.<br> However, Jiraiya was killed by Pain in a battle of Amegakure. But, I put Jiraiya before Pain. There is many reasons behind it. First of all, Pain knew everything about Jiraiya. He knew about Jiraiya's power, his technique and everything. But, Jiraiya knew nothing about him, before he came to Amegakure he didn't even know that Pain is Nagato. On the other hand, Jiraiya is a mortal human of blood and flesh. But Nagato's Painns were just dolls of corps and they can be revived every time after they are killed. Even after that, Jiraiya have killed one of them completely. It proves that Jiraiya is stronger than Nagato and many others.</p>

He have betrayed Konoha and Akatsuki in order to gain power. He does not like to work under anyone. He mainly left Konoha because he Sarutobi didn't select him as the Hokage and he left Akatsuki because He can not defeat a Sharingan user like Itachi at that stage. He always wanted to be a perfect being. As a result, he have learned many strong and forbidden Jutsu. He have updated second Hokage's reanimation Jutsu. He have made his body a snake. He is almost immortal. He would not be killed even if his head cut off from his body. However, it's not impossible for a Sharingan user to kill Orochimaru. He have to be killed from inside, like Sasuke and Itachi have done. But, there is no Guarantee that he would not be revived. ALthough, Sasuke was able to kill him because Orochimaru was weak, if Orochimaru have his full power it's almost impossible to kill him. However, Itachi was able to defeat him a few times even he under Orochimaru in this list. Only because, Sharingan is his one and only weakness.

He was a weak and kindhearted child who wanted to be the Hokage. But, everything changed after he was found by Madara and Rin was accidently killed by Kakashi. Madar turned him into a heartless strons Shinobi. He was the first Uchiha after Madara who have taked the blood of Hashirama. He can use Hashirama's wood element pretty well. He have killed a squad of Mist's Jonin and Many members of Yahiko's Akatsuki by using this. His Mongekeo Sharingan is quiet strong, too. He can non-materalize his body by using this. He can use Izanagi and a teleportation Jutsu named Kamui. Only these power makes him stronger than those who are after him in this list. but, he is not stopping here. He have taken Nagato's Rinnegan after he killed Konan, before the war Started. He was able to controll the power of Juubi, well. But, His Juubi was not strong as much as Madara's.

He can use wood statue, which are even larger than the nine-tailed beast or Perfect Susanoo. His sage mode is one of the strongest Sage mode in the history. Although, he is a celestiul level Shinobi.
